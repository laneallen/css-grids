# css-grids
CSS testing between CSS Grid and Flexbox. I'm currently working on a UI project that requires specific placement of items. The target browser is IE Edge in a controlled environment, which has support for CSS Grid, [but it's using an older specification](https://wpdev.uservoice.com/forums/257854-microsoft-edge-developer/suggestions/6514853-update-css-grid).

CSS Grid would be ideal in this situation, since some of the UI is being changed with ReactJS, and some of the elements span different parts of the grid.
